       <p>My name is Ian Fonzo, and I hoped to start a website where I could share my opinions on different gaming updates and eSports news. I have reached top 500 in both Overwatch 1 and Paladins as well as Global Elite in CS:GO and have had the opportunity to play amongst some of the most prolific pros in these relative games. Playing games at such a high level has given me certain insights that I think could be quite interesting when talking and writing about gaming, and I hope that you all find these articles as intriguing as I do!</p>
