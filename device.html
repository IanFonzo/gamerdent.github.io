        <p>Most avid CS:GO fans would tell you that Dev1ce, the 25 year old Danish AWPer for NIP, is one of the most calm and collected players in the current pro scene. However, during the 24th round playing against EIQ, Dev1ce found himself in a 1 vs 5 situation to bring the score back to 11-14. With an AWP in hand, Dev1ce effortlessly took down the first four players, but unfortunately was taken out by the last NIP member, and losing his chance to clutch the round.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Dev1ce might be able to find a career as a boxer after this, the hit not being something to scoff at. Viewers could see the Danish player’s knuckles extremely red, and the heavy monitor wobbling back and forth. Following this round, NIP called a timeout for a suspected damaged monitor.</p>
